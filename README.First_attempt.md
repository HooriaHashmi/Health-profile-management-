Hello guys,
This was my first github project that i decided to work on using C++ (object-oriented programming)
I uploaded three files in which two (1. extented_classhealthprofile.cpp 2. classhealthprofile.cpp) are the files containing classes
the last file which is the main file includes the classes files as well
I encountered so many errors in my code but i will like to highlight some extra features i was able to include as well as lessons i had to learn coding this into the nights

EXTRA FEATURES OF MY HEALTH PROFILE MANAGEMENT
Classhealthprofile.cpp file 
1. Multiple Classes for Structured Data Management:
Profile Class: This class is used to manage the name of a user and display it as well as the vitals.
Health_Information Class: This class extends functionality to store and manage health-related data.
Data Fields: Includes weight, height, body_temperature, and blood_sugar, which are initialized via the constructor.
Setters and Getters: Methods like set_weight, set_height, get_weight, and others allow for modifying and retrieving the health data.
BMI Calculation: A method to calculate BMI (BMI()) using the formula: weight / height^2. This is a useful health metric.
2. Modular Design: By dividing the program into two separate classes (Profile and Health_Information), the code is modular and easier to maintain.
The Profile class focuses on storing basic profile information (like the name), while Health_Information deals with health-related data.


Areas for Improvement or Additional Features:
Input Validation: Currently, the code does not handle input validation (e.g., ensuring that the weight, height, etc., are positive). You could add checks to ensure that these inputs are valid.

Additional Health Metrics: Adding more health-related metrics, such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc., would make the system more comprehensive.

Saving and Loading Profiles: You could add functionality to save profiles to a file and load them back, so data is persisted between program runs.

Methods for Displaying Health Information: While the Health_Information class stores health data, it does not have a method to display it. Adding a method to output health details
(e.g., weight, BMI, temperature, etc.) would be useful.

Inheritance: The Profile class could be a base class, and Health_Information could be derived from it, allowing shared attributes like name and displayProfile to be inherited.


Extended_classhealthprofile.cpp

1. 1. Inheritance and Class Structure:
Inheritance: The Extended_Health_Profile class is inheriting from the Health_Information class. While Health_Information is defined,
it is currently empty. By inheriting from Health_Information, Extended_Health_Profile can potentially use any properties or methods from Health_Information (though they are not yet implemented).
This sets up a good structure to extend the profile system further, e.g., you could add basic profile data like name in Health_Information and health data (like weight, height, etc.) in Extended_Health_Profile.
2. Health-Related Methods:
BMI Calculation (BMI): The BMI() method computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula weight / (height * height).
This is a common health metric that helps assess a person's body weight relative to their height.
This method is implemented as a constant method (const) since it doesn't modify the object's state. This is good practice as it ensures the integrity of the object’s data when performing calculations.
BMI Category (bmi_category): The bmi_category() method categorizes the BMI value into:
Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
Normal weight (18.5 <= BMI < 24.9)
Overweight (25 <= BMI < 29.9)
Obese (BMI >= 30) This feature helps to better understand the health status based on the BMI value.
Temperature Status (temperature_status): The temperature_status() method evaluates whether the body temperature is Low, Normal, or High, based on standard temperature ranges:
Low: Body temperature < 36.1°C
Normal: 36.1°C <= Body temperature <= 37.2°C
High: Body temperature > 37.2°C This feature provides feedback about the user’s body temperature and helps track fever or hypothermia.
Blood Sugar Status (blood_sugar_status): The blood_sugar_status() method categorizes the blood sugar level into:
Low: Blood sugar < 70 mg/dL
Normal: 70 <= Blood sugar <= 140 mg/dL
High: Blood sugar > 140 mg/dL This method helps in assessing the person’s blood sugar levels, potentially indicating hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
5. Profile Display (displayProfile):
Formatted Output: The displayProfile() method uses formatted output (with setw(15)) to neatly print the profile's details, including the BMI, temperature, and blood sugar. This enhances the readability of the information when displayed in the terminal.
The method prints the profile details with proper alignment for a better visual experience.
6. Encapsulation of Data:
Private Data Members: The data members like name, weight, height, body_temperature, and blood_sugar are kept private. This means that they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, which is a good practice for data encapsulation.
7. Potential Use of Inheritance (Future Implementation):
Although the Health_Information class is currently empty, this structure allows for future expansion. The Extended_Health_Profile class can inherit basic profile-related data
(like the name or other basic information) from Health_Information, making the overall system more flexible and maintainable.


Suggestions for Improvement or Additional Features:
Input Validation:
The current code does not check whether the values for weight, height, body temperature, or blood sugar are valid (e.g., positive numbers). Adding input validation would improve the reliability of the program.
Add More Vital Signs:
You could add more vital signs to the profile, such as blood pressure (e.g., systolic/diastolic) or heart rate. These additions would enhance the health data and provide a more comprehensive profile.
Health Record Management:
Implement functionality for storing and updating multiple health profiles. This could include storing the profiles in a list and allowing the user to select a profile by name.
Saving and Loading from File:
Adding functionality to save profiles to a file and load them from a file would allow the data to persist between program runs.
The profiles could be saved in a human-readable format, making it easier for users to understand the stored information when they review the file.
Improve Inheritance:
The Health_Information class could be used to store basic information (e.g., name) and then extended further in the Extended_Health_Profile class for more detailed health data. This would avoid redundancy and improve organization.
Display Feedback:
The feedback generated by generate_feedback() could be displayed to the user for quick reference about their health status.

Mainfile.cpp

Extra Features in the Provided Code:
1. Profile Management:
Create Profile: The program allows creating health profiles with input validation for weight, height, body temperature, and blood sugar.
View Profile: Profiles can be viewed by entering the profile name. It displays detailed information including BMI, temperature status, blood sugar status, and feedback.
Update Profile: Profiles can be updated with new data, such as weight, height, body temperature, and blood sugar, with proper input validation.
Delete Profile: Profiles can be deleted from the system.
2. File Handling:
Save Profiles to File: The system can save health profiles to a file (health_profiles.txt), making it possible to persist data across sessions.
Load Profiles from File: Profiles can be loaded from the saved file to restore them after the program is closed or restarted.
3. Data Validation:
Input Validation: Before accepting input for creating and updating profiles, the program ensures that:
Weight and height are positive.
Body temperature is within a valid range (35.0 to 42.0°C).
Blood sugar is non-negative.
4. Display and Interaction:
Display All Profiles: The system allows displaying all profiles currently in the system.
Menu System: A simple menu-driven interface allows users to select different actions, such as creating, viewing, updating, deleting profiles, and saving/loading from files.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring smoother interaction with the user.
5. Profile Feedback:
Generated Feedback: When viewing a profile, the program generates and displays feedback about the person's health based on their BMI, body temperature, and blood sugar levels.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Data Persistence: It’s important to handle file read/write errors gracefully to ensure robustness.
Profile Search: You could implement a search function that allows searching for profiles by multiple attributes (e.g., BMI category, temperature).
Enhance User Interface: Improve user interaction by adding more clear instructions and formatted output.
