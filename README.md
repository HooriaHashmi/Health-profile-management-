I have come to the end of my personal project
The file solution.cpp has a working code for my project 
I added extra features to enhance the efficiency of the program and to make it more user-interactive 
I took into consideration the design so as to make it more user-friendly 
clear instructions are given where user input is taken 
Also, the project made detailed use of input validations to ensure that users enter right paramters
Header guards were used to prevent redefinitions of files
I made use of getters and setters to allow smooth flow of code
I divided the project into three files 
Two files include classes that focuses on just the profile and the other on the management of the profile
Also made use of switch statments to allow user to choose options they want to work on
Do-while, while and for loops were also implemented in this project
Made use of escape sequences as well as variable declarations
There was a clear implementation of menu-driven concepts
What's more is the conscious use of comments to make easy reading and debugging the code
There was use of vectors as well
If-else statements were also used

What is unique?
1. My health profile manager not only keeps track of patient health history it also has a system of making recommendations based on user input
2. There is a thorough implementaion of input validation system that makes sure that users also enter values within defined ranges
3. There is enough vital information requirement that makes it even easier for doctors to track your health progress
